The recognition of patterns that span multiple timescales is a critical function of the brain. 
This poses a conceptual challenge for all neuron models that rely on the passive integration of synaptic currents and are therefore limited to the rigid millisecond-timescale of post-synaptic currents.
However, detailed biological measurements recently revealed that single neurons are capable of processing and retaining information on a much longer timescale of hundreds of milliseconds through localized, actively generated \emph{dendritic plateau potentials}. 
Based on these findings, we derive a conceptually simple mechanistic model of how a neuron's dendritic morphology determines the interaction between these localized processes and thus gives rise to complex non-linear computation across multiple timescales.
We demonstrate how this mechanism enables individual neurons to solve difficult, behaviorally relevant tasks that are commonly studied on the network-level, such as the detection of variable input sequences 
or the integration of evidence on the timescale of a hundred milliseconds. 
We characterize the model using rate-based analysis tools, and demonstrate why such a mechanism of dendritic computation eludes this type of analysis.
We therefore conclude that the interaction of plateau potentials may be a more fundamental and ubiquitous principle of neural computation
than commonly acknowledged, and give directions toward possible experiments that could provide crucial experimental evidence for or against this proposition.





In summary, we have presented and analyzed an intentionally simple model of neural computation based purely on the interaction of coincident spikes and dendritic plateau potentials.
This reveals, how dendritic morphology can implement and compose a wide range of non-linear computational functions.  
Two key features of this computational mechanism are its invariance to variability in the precise timing of individual inputs and its ability to operate on much longer timescales than that of post-synaptic potentials. 
We have highlighted the importance of these features in two behaviorally relevant tasks: the detection of sequences and the integration of weak signals on long timescales. 
Since these properties are hard to detect by conventional rate-based methods, we have proposed alternative analysis tools and experiments to identify what role this form of dendritic computation really plays in individual neurons.
We therefore believe that our results will be relevant for both experimentalists and theoreticians working on more detailed models that include dendritic dynamics such as subthreshold integration of EPSPs, retrograde activation of plateaus by backpropagating action potentials (or other plateau potentials), and various forms of plasticity.
