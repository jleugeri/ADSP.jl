# Active dendritic sequence processing (ADSP)

This package contains the accompanying code for the publication
"Event-based pattern detection in active dendrites"


# Files
This package is organized as follows:

* *model.jl*   defines the basic data structures used throughout the package
* *simulate.jl*   defines functions that implement basic simulation of neurons and networks
* *utils.jl*    defines additional utility functions for plotting, generating input etc.


# Examples

The preprint contains 4 experiments, that can be run via:

* `examples/place_cells/neuron_paths.jl`
* `examples/integrator/integrator.jl` 
* `examples/rate_coding/plot_functions.jl` 
* `examples/rate_coding/plot_sta.jl`
